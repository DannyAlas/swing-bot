# Swing Bot

A general asynchronous bot for our private Discord servers. 

**Python 3.8 or higher is required | Built on discord.py version 1.7.3**
>**_NOTE:_** This is a public archive of our private GitLab repository, NOT a fully updated and working bot. 

We thought some would enjoy the functionalties we've implemented so feel free to take as you please. Since this is NOT a fully functional bot, to get up running you will need your own setup and linker functions.
